INTERACTION (D3 etc) -----------------------------

* Scatterplot highlighted blob persists after sorter is changed -
while it would be good to keep the unit highlighted, so sprays update,
the y-coord is not being updated.

* spike sprays...



COSMETIC --------------------------------


LAYOUT ON MAIN PAGE - collision of boxes

top-right:
Precision  1-(...)    needs equals sign, or more space.


top row:

Restore "About" as link - otherwise too hard to find (2 levels in)

(i) icon always bumping into "Metrics" on top row.



DETAILS page:

Click a "marker" -> unit.

Explain that blob area is proportional to num firing events,

and that color indicates which recording within the study.



METRICS:


ABOUT:

History:

flesh out future plans.



ALGS:

Either have a heading matching other pages, or kill (or shrink) all headings
on pages!

move blurb to bottom.


BOTTOM OF EACH PAGE: Footer.js


---------------------- DONE ---------------------------


The converse cannot happen ..  -> explain can't have >1 GT matching a
single sorted event.
