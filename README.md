The purpose of this repo is to sketch out a white paper for planning and preparing a community spike sorting validation and comparison website, hosted at Flatiron. This is a follow up from the discussion at the Janelia spike sorting meeting of 3/22/18.

The Flatiron spike-sorting team: Jeremy Magland, James Jun, Alex Barnett, Leslie Greengard, Witold Wysota.

This project is distinct from our own spike sorting package, [MountainSort](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainsort)
